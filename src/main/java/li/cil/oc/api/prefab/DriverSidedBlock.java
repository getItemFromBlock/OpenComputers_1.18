/**
 * If you wish to create a block component for a third-party block, i.e. a block
 * for which you do not control the tile entity, such as vanilla blocks, you
 * will need a block driver.
 * <br>
 * This prefab allows creating a driver that works for a specified list of item
 * stacks (to support different blocks with the same id but different metadata
 * values).
 * <br>
 * You still have to provide the implementation for creating its environment, if
 * any.
 * <br>
 * To limit sidedness, I recommend overriding {@link #worksWith(World, BlockPos, Direction)}
 * and calling <code>super.worksWith</code> in addition to the side check.
 *
 * @see li.cil.oc.api.network.ManagedEnvironment
